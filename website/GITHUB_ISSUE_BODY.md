# Website Rebuild with Astro

## Description

- [ ] Add favicon and optimize logo usage
- [ ] Test responsiveness across devices and browsers
- [x] Optimize font loading and usage
- [ ] Add SEO meta tags and Open Graph data
- [ ] Check accessibility (contrast, alt texts, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Remove unused assets and code
- [ ] Prepare deployment (build, setup and push to GitHub pages)
- [ ] DNS setup for custom domain
- [ ] Set up basic regression tests (should cover the main pages)
- [ ] Regression tests should be automated and run once a day

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All pages are responsive and work well on mobile and desktop
